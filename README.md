## ‚ú® Features

Based on the provided code, this project includes the following features:

* **Real-Time Data**: Fetches the latest 30-day earthquake summary from the official [USGS API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson).
* **Interactive Map**: Utilizes **Leaflet.js** to display earthquake locations on a world map.
* **Clustered Markers**: Employs the **Leaflet.markercluster** plugin to group nearby earthquake markers for a cleaner view at a distance.
* **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can filter the displayed earthquakes by **minimum magnitude** and **geographical region**.
* **Color-Coded Visualization**: Markers are color-coded based on magnitude, providing an at-a-glance understanding of their severity.
* **Live Dashboard**:
    * Counts of total and "strong" (‚â•4.5 magnitude) earthquakes.
    * A scrollable list of recent earthquake events.
    * A **Chart.js** bar chart showing the distribution of magnitudes.
    * A **Chart.js** line chart tracking the frequency of earthquakes with each data fetch.
* **Major Earthquake Alerts**: Triggers a browser `alert()` and an audible beep for any detected earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 or greater.
* **Auto-Refresh**: The application automatically fetches new data every 60 seconds to stay up-to-date.
